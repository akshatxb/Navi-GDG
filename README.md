# Navi - AI-Powered Precision Agriculture Platform

> This project was submitted for the [GDG on Campus Solutions Challenge 2025](https://vision.hack2skill.com/event/solutionschallenge2025/). It is an archive repository and not maintained for active development.

## Project Overview
Navi is an AI-powered web application designed to revolutionize farm management through intelligent inventory control, real-time data analysis, and computer vision technology. Our platform helps farmers digitally manage their inventory, receive real-time agricultural recommendations, and utilize AI/ML-based live inventory scanning and data integration for more efficient and profitable farming.

## Problem Statement
Farmers lack real-time insights and AI-driven recommendations for optimal crop selection, fertilizer usage, field conditions, and inventory management, leading to inefficiencies in agriculture.

## Our Solution
Navi combines cutting-edge AI with practical farming solutions to make precision agriculture accessible to every farmer. The platform offers:

1. **Smart Inventory Management** - Digital tracking with real-time updates
2. **Live Object Detection** - AI-powered scanning that instantly updates inventory status
3. **Data-Driven Recommendations** - Personalized insights for optimal farming decisions
4. **Intelligent Agricultural Assistant** - Context-aware AI chatbot for personalized farming guidance

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Inventory Management System
- **Live Object Detection & Scanning** - Computer vision technology that automatically identifies and counts inventory items in real-time
- **Automated Inventory Updates** - Scan products with your device camera to instantly update stock levels
- **Inventory Analytics Dashboard** - Comprehensive view of stock levels, usage patterns, and reorder notifications
- **Stock-Out Prediction** - AI algorithms that forecast potential shortages before they occur

### Intelligent Agricultural Assistant
- **Context-Aware AI Chatbot** - Virtual assistant that understands farm-specific context and remembers previous interactions
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding** - Interprets complex agricultural queries and provides relevant, actionable information
- **Secure Guardrails** - Ensures all recommendations adhere to agricultural best practices and safety standards
- **Multi-turn Conversations** - Maintains conversation context for nuanced problem-solving and detailed guidance
- **Knowledge Integration** - Leverages real-time farm data alongside agricultural best practices for tailored advice

### Real-Time Agricultural Recommendations
- **Crop Selection Advisor** - Personalized suggestions based on soil conditions, climate data, and market trends
- **Fertilizer Optimization** - Smart recommendations for fertilizer types and application schedules
- **Pest Management Intelligence** - Early warning system for potential outbreaks with treatment suggestions
- **Weather-Based Planning** - Integration of weather forecasts with farming activities scheduling

### Data Integration & Analytics
- **Unified Data Platform** - Centralized system that connects inventory, crop data, climate information, and market trends
- **Performance Tracking** - Monitor farm productivity, inventory turnover, and resource utilization
- **Predictive Analytics** - ML models that suggest actions to maximize yield while optimizing resource usage
- **Mobile Accessibility** - Access critical data and scanning features from anywhere on the farm

## What Makes Our Solution Different

### Advanced Computer Vision Implementation
Our object detection system allows farmers to simply point their device camera at storage areas to automatically identify, count, and update inventory items in real-timeâ€”eliminating manual counting and data entry.

### Context-Aware Agricultural AI Assistant
Unlike generic chatbots, our AI assistant maintains awareness of your specific farm context, inventory status, and historical data to provide truly personalized guidance that evolves with your farming operation.

### Integrated Farm Management Ecosystem
Unlike standalone farm management tools, Navi connects inventory management directly with agricultural recommendations, creating a comprehensive system where inventory status informs farming decisions and vice versa.

### Google Tech Integration
Utilizes Google developer tools for enhanced efficiency and scalability with Object Detection, AI, and Real-Time Data Analytics.

### Predictive ML Models
Leverages real-time data on stock levels, pricing trends, market demand, crop yields, and supplier performance to automate restocking, predict shortages, optimize pricing, and enhance decision-making with AI-driven insights.
